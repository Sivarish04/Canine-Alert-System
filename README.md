Canine Alert System
The Canine Alert System is an innovative IoT-based safety solution designed for bike riders to protect against chasing dogs. Using an ESP32-CAM for detection, the system alerts the rider via a display, activates a buzzer, and deploys a servo-powered leg protection mechanism to ensure safety. This system is ideal for riders frequently traveling in areas prone to dog chases.

Features
Dog Detection: Utilizes the ESP32-CAM to detect chasing dogs in real time.
Rider Alerts: Sends immediate alerts to the bike-mounted display.
Audible Warning: Activates a buzzer to warn the rider and possibly deter the dog.
Leg Protection: A servo mechanism deploys protective covers over the riderâ€™s legs.
Compact and Reliable: Designed for seamless integration with bikes.
Prerequisites
Hardware:
ESP32-CAM module
OLED display or similar for alerts
Servo motor
Buzzer
Power supply (e.g., battery or USB power)
Software:
Arduino IDE with ESP32 libraries
Python (if additional processing is required on a computer)
OpenCV for object detection (if running detection on a host system)
Installation
Set up the ESP32-CAM:

Flash the ESP32-CAM with the provided firmware using the Arduino IDE.
Ensure the camera module is securely connected.
Hardware Assembly:

Connect the display, buzzer, and servo motor to the ESP32-CAM.
Securely attach the system to the bike.
Code Deployment:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Sivarish04/Canine-Alert-System.git
Load and upload the ESP32-CAM sketch via Arduino IDE.
Test the Python script (if applicable) to verify detection and communication.
Testing:

Test the system in a controlled environment to ensure dog detection, alerts, and leg protection deployment work correctly.
Usage
Turn on the system when starting your ride.
The ESP32-CAM continuously monitors for chasing dogs.
Upon detection:
The display shows an alert.
The buzzer sounds to warn the rider.
The servo activates, deploying leg protection for the rider.
React accordingly to avoid any potential incidents.
Future Enhancements
AI Integration: Use advanced models to recognize and differentiate dog behaviors.
GPS Integration: Add location tracking for safety alerts.
Compact Design: Optimize hardware for a more ergonomic setup.
